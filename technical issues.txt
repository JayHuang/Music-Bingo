Technical issues:

Jay:
AJAX request for JSON data errors (file:/// requests are blocked, need a web server)
Wrap link listing in li not working (Element has to be attached to the DOM)
'Display: none' on hover causes flicker (Element is no longer in render tree, so it loses hover then gets it again)
Splitting elements across columns (Use CSS3 column-count)
Get elements in columns to fill up as much space as possible (dynamic JS)
Can't revert element resize on hover (Need separate for each loop to store original dimensions, or pollute global variable)
Set last clicked song as played
Artist name from JSON returns as undefined (it was " artist" in JSON, not "artist")
Hovered element + resize (to small, then back again) causes the hovered element to be smaller
Hover element expansion causes re-flow for columns (elements move spill over to next column) Use JS instead of CSS3 columns
When a song could not be found, the error doesn't disappear once a different song is picked - UNRESOLVED
Queued song doesn't jump to beginning when last song in list is played
Reset doesn't properly reset all play counters
Different margins after hover expansion (change inline-block to block)
Moving from CSS3 column to full JS column implementation caused bugs in playing/queued transition
Spacebar still scrolls page even when preventDefault is called (scroll event fires on keydown, not keyup)

Enoch:
Working on autoAddSongs feature:
  - unable to find filepath (resolved - only with webkitdirectory)
  - unable to get file names in an angularjs event (resolved)
  - unable to get file extensions in an angularjs event (resolved)

Performance tweaks:
Hover on scroll disabled - *****
Selector optimizations - ***
Batch adds to DOM - ****
Grouped DOM reads/writes - **
