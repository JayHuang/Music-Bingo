Music-Bingo
===========

Repository for the Music Bingo project (music player component)

###Setup

Create a folder called 'songs' and put the mp3 files for the songs in there.  
The song name, artist name, and filename are located in a JSON file inside the 'js' folder.  
Example: js/songlist2.js  
Make sure the paths for the mp3 files match the paths in the JSON file and change those as you wish.  
  
Look for the following line in index.html  

> <script src="js/songlist2.js"></script>  

And replace `songlist2.js` with the appropriate songlist.
